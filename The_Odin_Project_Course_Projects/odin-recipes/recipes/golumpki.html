    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Golumpki, or cabbage rolls, are a traditional Polish dish made by wrapping a savory mixture of ground meat and rice in cabbage leaves, then baking them in a rich tomato sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cabbage – White cabbage works best. Choose a large, firm head with flexible leaves. (Tip: Savoy cabbage makes rolling easier if you want a softer leaf.)</li>
        <li>Ground Pork – Traditional for a Polish golumpki recipe. You can substitute with ground beef, turkey, or even a pork-beef blend for extra depth.</li>
        <li>Rice – White rice is most common, but brown rice or barley add a nuttier texture. I sometimes use leftover rice—it saves time and works beautifully.</li>
        <li>Onion – Freshly sautéed onion gives the filling a rich base of flavor. You could also add garlic for a bolder taste.</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste & Broth – They form the base of the sauce. Chicken broth makes the sauce lighter, while beef broth gives a deeper taste.</li>
        <li>Herbs (Oregano, Paprika, Thyme) – These add layers of flavor. My babcia often sprinkled a little marjoram instead of oregano, a very Polish touch.</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream (Optional) – For a creamier sauce. If you want a lighter version, skip it, but trust me—it’s worth it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>Prepare the Cabbage: Core the cabbage, then blanch it in boiling water for 5 minutes. Let it cool slightly, then carefully peel the leaves. Trim any thick veins so they roll easily.</ol>
        <ol>Cook the Onions: In a skillet, heat oil and sauté the chopped onions until soft and translucent. Set aside to cool.</ol>
        <ol>Mix the Filling: In a large bowl, combine ground pork, cooked rice, breadcrumbs, cooled onions, salt, and pepper. Mix thoroughly until the filling holds together.</ol>
        <ol>Assemble the Rolls: Lay out a cabbage leaf, place a spoonful of filling in the center, fold in the sides, and roll tightly. Repeat until all filling is used.</ol>
        <ol>Prepare the Sauce: In a bowl, whisk together broth, tomato paste, paprika, oregano, and thyme. Stir in cream if using for extra richness.</ol>
        <ol>Layer in the Dish: Spread some tomato sauce at the bottom of a baking dish (this prevents burning). Arrange the rolls seam-side down.</ol>
        <ol>Cover and Cook: Pour the remaining sauce over the top, cover with foil or a lid, and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 1–1.5 hours, or simmer on low heat until tender.</ol>
        <ol>Serve Hot: Spoon extra sauce over the rolls before serving. Traditionally, these stuffed cabbage rolls Polish style are served with mashed potatoes or fresh bread.</ol>
