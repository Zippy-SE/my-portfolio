    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.25 litres chicken stock</li>
        <li>a thumb-sized piece ginger shredded</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
        <li>1 red chilli deseeded and sliced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 tsp flavourless oil</li>
        <li>300g egg noodles</li>
        <li>1 pak choi quartered lengthways</li>
        <li>2 handfuls kale chopped</li>
        <li>a small bunch coriander</li>
        <li>½ red onion very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 lime juiced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the chicken stock into a large pan with ¾ of the ginger and red chilli, all of the garlic and the soy sauce, and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer gently for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, put the chicken breasts between two pieces of clingfilm and gently tap with a rolling pin until an even 1cm thickness. Season well and drizzle with a little oil. Heat a griddle pan over a medium-high heat and cook the chicken for 4-5 minutes on each side or until cooked through and charred. Rest for 5 minutes on a plate under foil, then slice.</li>
        <li>Add the noodles and pak choi to the broth, and simmer for 2 minutes, then add the kale and simmer for a further minute.</li>
        <li>Use tongs to divide the noodles and veg between 3 wide bowls. Ladle over the broth, divide the chicken and put on top with the remaining ginger and chilli, and sprinkle over the coriander, red onion and lime juice.</li>
    </ol>
